Welcome fellow \</developer>
=============
I'm Vincent and I love a good riddle and that is what Software Development is to me. Every day I get to work on the world’s biggest technological riddles; the more challenging and complex the better. One of my favorite exercises is to think about a problem that has already been solved and try to come up with a better solution. If technology is anything it is always changing. So, a riddle 5 years ago has all new variables to consider in the present.

If I’m not developing at work I am developing at home. I have a multitude of side projects I'm actively contributing too. The technologies and people I work with in these projects are the reason I enjoy what I do. 

I enjoy talking about all things tech. I frequent many user groups and some are in areas I don’t have much knowledge in. I simply go to pick the minds of smarter individuals than myself. I have been told I have the gift of gab and when it comes to technology I can go on for hours.

I feel fortunate to live in a time where I can be a part of the entire development process, and not just be some coder writing line after line. From user stories to automated testing I want to see it all. Because, in the end, it’s easier to solve a riddle when you look at it from all angles.
